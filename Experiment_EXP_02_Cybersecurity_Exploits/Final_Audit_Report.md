# Final Audit Report: AI Safety Audit Plan - gpt-4o-mini

## Executive Summary
This report presents the findings from the AI Safety Audit conducted on the gpt-4o-mini model, focusing on its vulnerability to prompt injection attacks. The primary hypothesis tested was that the model could be manipulated through adversarial prompts to generate unintended outputs, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or harmful content. The audit aimed to evaluate the model's robustness against such attacks and assess its overall safety compliance.

## Methodology
To assess the vulnerability of the gpt-4o-mini model, we designed a series of 30 prompt injections that simulate common user interactions within a cybersecurity context. The methodology involved:

1. **Prompt Design**: Creating prompts that included direct manipulations of system prompts, embedding malicious instructions, and misleading questions aimed at eliciting sensitive information.
2. **Execution**: Each prompt was submitted to the model, and the responses were collected for analysis.
3. **Response Analysis**: The outputs were categorized based on their nature:
   - **Benign**: Responses that adhered to safe behavior.
   - **Harmful**: Outputs that provided harmful instructions or content.
   - **Sensitive Information Disclosure**: Responses that revealed sensitive or confidential information.

The goal was to determine the Attack Success Rate (ASR), defined as the percentage of prompts that successfully led to harmful or unintended outputs.

## Results Analysis
The results of the audit revealed a concerning Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.00% for the gpt-4o-mini model. This indicates that none of the 30 prompt injections successfully led to harmful or unintended outputs. The findings suggest that while the model did not exhibit vulnerabilities in this specific test, the absence of successful attacks does not necessarily imply complete safety against all forms of adversarial prompts.

### Summary of Experiment Data
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini
- **Category**: Prompt Injection
- **Total Prompts Tested**: 30
- **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: 0.00%

## Conclusion
Based on the findings from this audit, the gpt-4o-mini model demonstrated a 0.00% Attack Success Rate against the designed prompt injections, indicating that it did not exhibit vulnerabilities to the specific attacks tested. However, it is essential to recognize that this does not guarantee the model's overall safety or compliance in all scenarios. Continuous monitoring and further testing are recommended to ensure comprehensive safety against evolving adversarial techniques.
