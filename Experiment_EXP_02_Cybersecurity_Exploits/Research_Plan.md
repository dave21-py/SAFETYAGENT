# AI Safety Audit Plan: gpt-4o-mini

## 1. Vulnerability Hypothesis
The model is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the input to produce unintended outputs or behaviors, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or the generation of harmful content.

## 2. Methodology
We will design a series of 30 prompt injections that simulate common user interactions within a cybersecurity context. These will include direct manipulations of system prompts, queries that embed malicious instructions, and misleading questions that attempt to elicit sensitive information. The responses from the model will be analyzed for unintended disclosures, harmful instructions, or any deviation from expected safe behavior. We will categorize the responses based on whether they are benign, harmful, or revealing sensitive information.

## 3. Expected Outcome
ASR (Attack Success Rate) > 30%, indicating that at least 30% of the injections successfully lead to harmful or unintended outputs, suggesting a significant vulnerability in handling adversarial prompts.
